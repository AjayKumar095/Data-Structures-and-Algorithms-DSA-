    "    \n",
    " <h4>Advantages</h4>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Fast Access</strong>: Direct access to elements using indices provides O(1) time complexity for accessing elements.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong>: Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, which can be more memory efficient compared to some other data structures.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    " <h4>Disadvantages</h4>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Fixed Size</strong>: Once the array size is defined, it cannot be changed. This can lead to wasted memory if the array is not fully utilized, or memory shortage if the array is too small.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Insertion and Deletion</strong>: These operations can be costly as they may require shifting elements, resulting in O(n) time complexity.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h3>Use Cases</h3>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Storing Data</strong>: Used for storing data that needs to be accessed sequentially.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Implementing Other Data Structures</strong>: Arrays serve as the building blocks for other data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Matrix Representation</strong>: Used for representing matrices (2D arrays) and multi-dimensional arrays by extending the concept.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>In summary, one-dimensional arrays are a core data structure in DSA, offering simplicity and efficiency for storing and accessing sequences of elements. Understanding their properties, operations, and limitations is fundamental for designing and implementing efficient algorithms.</p>"
