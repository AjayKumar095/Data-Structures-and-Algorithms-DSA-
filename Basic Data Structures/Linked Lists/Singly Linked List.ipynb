    "A Singly Linked List is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of elements where each element is linked to the next one in the sequence. It is called \"singly linked\" because each node only contains a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence and not to any previous node."

    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, singly linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, making efficient use of memory.\n",
    "- Ease of Insertion/Deletion: Inserting or deleting a node does not require shifting other elements, making these operations efficient.\n",

    "<h4 style='color: green;'>Disadvantages</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Overhead: Each node requires extra memory for the Next reference.\n",
    "- Sequential Access: Accessing elements requires traversing the list from the head to the desired node, leading to O(n) time complexity for searches.\n",
    "- No Backward Traversal: A singly linked list does not support traversing backward through the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4 style='color: green;'>Applications</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Singly linked lists are used in various applications, such as:\n",
    "    - Implementing stacks and queues.\n",
    "    - Managing memory through linked allocation.\n",
    "    - As a foundation for more complex data structures like hash tables and adjacency lists in graphs."
