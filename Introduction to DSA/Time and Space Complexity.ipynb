    "<h3>1. Algorithm</h3>\n",
    "<p>An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a problem or perform a task. The performance of an algorithm is evaluated based on time and space complexity. For example i have to compute the mean of some inputs, i write a function or algorithm to find the mean of inputs. so the time and space complexity is totally depend on size of the input. As the input size become bigger the time to compute the mean and storage to store this input is grow respectivly.</p>\n",
